# A script to easily create the skeletal structure of a website

##When using this script, put into the **base directory** where you wish to create your site structure.
###I.e. i have mine in /var/wwww/.

###then use it by typing: *./makeSite <nameOfNewSite>* and hit **enter**. Wait awhile, and boom.

###This includes a directory that I use to collect js libraries and recopy them to the new site.... In the script this is    /home/chris/Documents/jsLibs.

###I will soon refactor this to be more ambiguous so that it will work for others. I do suggest having a javascript library directory and to copy it to each new site. Makes it easier to create with different frameworks and then just remove the libraries you didn't use. I find this to be more apt to allowing me to think freely when design.
